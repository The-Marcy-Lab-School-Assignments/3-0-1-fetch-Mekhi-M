# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

We pass a `url` and a `HTTP verb`. The `url` tells the server where the client wants to access information from, while the `HTTP verb` tells the server what action the client wants to enact on that information. If `fetch()` is used with just a `url` passed, then it will automatically assume that the `HTTP verb` is `GET`.

Fetch returns a promise that has the response as its resolve value. Response is an object that has many useful properties to use.
