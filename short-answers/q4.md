# Question

Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - This means that the request has succeeded, though "succeeded" means different things depending on the HTTP method used.

2. 201 - This means that the request has succeeded after a POST/PUT request. This also means that the new resource was created.

3. 204 - This means that there was nothing to send back for the request, but the info could still be useful to have returned.

4. 404 - This typically means that the URL sent by fetch did not lead to a resource.

5. 500 - This means that the server has messed up on its end somehow.
