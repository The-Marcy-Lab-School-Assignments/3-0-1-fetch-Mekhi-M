# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer

The server sends the HTTP status code. The point of the status code is to give the client information on whether or not the data they were looking for was found. If it wasn't, the status code will tell you why the information that was requested was not sent back in the response.

This is a good answer but I can have more clarity and can be more precises.

1. Your explanation correctly identifies that the server sends the status code. Also, your explanation about the purpose of status codes is good, but it can be expanded to include more contexts beyond just whether the data was found. You mentioned that status codes indicate whether the data was found and, if not, why it wasn't sent back. However, HTTP status codes serve a broader purpose than just indicating the presence or absence of data.
1. Providing examples of common status codes and a brief description of their meanings would give a clearer picture of how status codes function.
