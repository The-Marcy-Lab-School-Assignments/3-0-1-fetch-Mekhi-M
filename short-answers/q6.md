# Question

`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This tells us if the request was successful.

2. `Response.status` - This tells us what was wrong with the request if it was not successful.

3. `Response.url` - This is the url of the response.

4. `Response.headers` - This is the `Headers` object of the response.

Response.ok:

Good but could be more specific. It should state that it returns true if the status code is in the range 200-299.

Response.status:

This property not only indicates what was wrong with the request if it was unsuccessful but provides the HTTP status code of the response, which could also indicate successful requests.

Response.url:

You could have expanded to specify that it gives the URL of the response after any redirects.

Response.headers:

Describe what the Headers object represents and how it can be used.
