# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer

The server sends the HTTP status code. The point of the status code is to give the client information on whether or not the data they were looking for was found. If it wasn't, the status code will tell you why the information that was requested was not sent back in the response.
