# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

It is the pattern of communication between a client and a server. The server is always looking for a request, but it cannot send anything unless it receives said request. Clients are the ones that send the request to the server and after the client send the request, the server will process that request and send a response back to the client.
