# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

We pass a `url` and a `HTTP verb`. The `url` tells the server where the client wants to access information from, while the `HTTP verb` tells the server what action the client wants to enact on that information. If `fetch()` is used with just a `url` passed, then it will automatically assume that the `HTTP verb` is `GET`.

Fetch returns a promise that has the response as its resolve value. Response is an object that has many useful properties to use.

1. You were right that we passing the URL
1. The second argument of fetch is not just the HTTP verb; it's an optional configuration object that can include the HTTP method, headers, body, and other settings.
1. Your description of the response object is too vague. It's important to mention that the response object includes methods to handle the response data, such as json(), text(), and blob().
